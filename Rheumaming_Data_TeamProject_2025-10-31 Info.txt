Tracker: Amazfit Bi5 Unity fitness tracker. 

We obtain the dataset via an application called Gadgetbridge. This application
serves as a means for downloading tracker data without the need for the vendor
application Zepp, providing data security without the possibility of data leakage
to the server from the device’s original location.

HUAMI_EXTENDED_ACTIVITY_SAMPLE_*.csv is a wearable “extended activity” time-series where each row is one reading at a specific moment from a specific device for a specific visit of a user. It has 11 columns:
TIMESTAMP is the capture time in seconds.
DEVICE_ID is an integer identifying which watch produced the reading;
USER_ID encodes user and visit together as user.visit (the integer part is the user, the digit after the dot is the visit index where .0 = first visit, .1 = second visit, etc.; e.g., 1.0 = user 1 first visit, 5.1 = user 5 second visit).
RAW_INTENSITY is an activity/movement intensity value (unitless vendor index; higher ≈ more motion; commonly 0–199 here) useful for detecting active vs. sedentary periods
STEPS is the steps counted within the sampling interval (often 0 for rest, spikes when walking/running; max values reflect short bursts)
RAW_KIND is a device-specific activity code that label the kind of activity/state according to the firmware (treat as categories)
HEART_RATE is beats-per-minute when available, with 255 typically meaning “no HR available/missing”
UNKNOWN1 is a firmware flag/quality/aux field
SLEEP, DEEP_SLEEP, and REM_SLEEP are vendor sleep metrics per timestamp (zero when not sleeping; non-zero during sleep windows
Sampling is typically ~1 minute for a given device/visit, with natural gaps (device not worn, no signal, sleep detection batching).


HUAMI_SPO2_SAMPLE_*.csv is a wearable oxygen-saturation (SpO₂) time-series where each row is one reading at a specific moment from a specific device (and user).
TYPE_NUM is a measurement-type code—in this file it denotes SpO₂ (commonly a fixed value like 0 here and useful in mixed-signal pipelines); and SPO2 is the blood oxygen saturation percentage reported by the device—an integer 0–100 where typical healthy at-rest values are around 95–100% (higher = better oxygenation). Readings are usually taken about every 5 minutes with natural gaps (device not worn, no signal, battery).

HUAMI_STRESS_SAMPLE_*.csv is a wearable stress time-series where each row is one reading at a specific moment from a particular device
TYPE_NUM is a measurement-type code that here denotes stress (often a fixed value in this file, useful when multiple signal types share a schema); and STRESS is the device’s unitless stress score/index (higher = more estimated stress), intended for relative trends (hour-to-hour, day-to-day, device-to-device). Readings are usually taken about every 5 minutes, with natural gaps when the device isn’t worn/has no signal.
